    My recent project titled 'Graphical Image as Password,' where I leveraged a combination of Java, JDBC, HTML, and CSS to create an innovative authentication system. In this project, I implemented a secure login mechanism that replaces traditional text-based passwords with graphical images. Users are prompted to select and remember a specific graphical image, which serves as their unique password. The backend of the system is powered by Java and JDBC for seamless interaction with the database, ensuring robust data storage and retrieval. The frontend, designed using HTML and CSS, provides an intuitive and visually appealing interface for users to engage with the authentication process.
